# Machine Learning Projects

In this repository you will find my Data Science projects focused on Machine Learning. All projects are introduced with a brief description of the business context, the problem to be solved, the questions to be answered and a short description of the datasets and where it come from. I will guide you through all steps since data collection, preparation, data cleanning , data preparation and the data analysis made to find the answers and insights that we need.

All projects were developed using Python and its main data analysis and machine learning libraries on Jupyter Notebook. The datasets can be find in the datasets folder, with the same title as the project where it being loaded and used.
